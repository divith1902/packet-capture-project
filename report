Packet Capture & Traffic Analysis using Wireshark
1. Introduction
In modern computer networks, monitoring traffic and analyzing packets is a crucial part of
cybersecurity. Packet capture helps understand data flow, detect threats, and troubleshoot issues.
Wireshark is a widely used protocol analyzer for network packet capture and analysis.
2. Objective
• Capture live network packets using Wireshark.
• Analyze ICMP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS packets.
• Understand encrypted vs unencrypted traffic.
• Study packet headers, protocol information.
3. Tools & Environment- Kali Linux (Traffic monitoring)- Wireshark (Packet analysis)- Browser (Traffic generation)- GitHub (Project upload)
4. Methodology
Started Wireshark, selected interface, captured packets. Generated network traffic using ping, DNS
lookup, HTTP/HTTPS.
5. Observations
ICMP – Request/Reply visible.
DNS – Domain resolution captured.
HTTP – Data visible in plaintext.
HTTPS – Encrypted traffic observed.
6. Filters Used
icmp, dns, http, tls, tcp, udp
7. Results
Successfully captured & analyzed traffic patterns, protocol behavior & security differences.
8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates Wireshark usage in real-time packet analysis, helping understand network
communication & security importance.
